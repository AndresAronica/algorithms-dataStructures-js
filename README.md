## About The Project

Welcome! <br>
This repo is the practical part of the following course<br>
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/">JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass - Udemy</a><br>
The course covers a lot of Algorithms & Data Structures, with their corresponding Time Complexity (and Space Complexity in some cases)<br>
The course was in plain JS, so thats why the repo is also in plain JS.<br>
<b>This is a repo created just for learning purposes, and you are free to use it however you want!</b>


## Built With

The proyect is build entirely with JS, having an html class for testing purposes only <br>
- ![JS][js-badge]
- ![HTML][html-badge]

## Proyect Structure
The proyect is divided in folders for Algorithms, Data Structures, and two folders for Exercises.<br>
Every class has the explanations of the Algo/DS with the corresponding Time Complexity.

## Considerations

In order to test any of the classes, you just have to change the script tag in the index.html file.
